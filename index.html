    <!-- instructions
    You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.

The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

Don't forget to include a countdown timer. -->
<!-- Pseudo Code
Wait for user input to start game with an onclick element to call a funciton to start running all script
Timer starts as soon as user clicks start button - set a timer/interval for 120 seconds when timer is complete the page will then run a function 
that counts the correct answers, wrong answers and unanswered questions this page writes over all existing html (inner.html)
the questions will be multiple choice (3 options a, b, c)
you will need to make vars for following items
timer, answer key (array), total correct answers, total missed answers, total unanswered questions, (possibly user guess?)
a radio button will give the user options to choose the answer, a radio button returns a true/false response 
create a way to take data from the user click and compare it to the index position for the array containing the answers 
create an else if statment that takes the user input and compares against the asnwer key if correct add to correct answers, if 
incorrect add to this, else unasnwered add to this (this would be for unanswered)
possible way to change radio button to an answer if else statement so for example you could have four buttons 
for four possible answers if button one equals true then user guess = a, if button two equals true = b 
make buttons where you can only click one button not multiple at each question 

choicesArray[2] = [{
    text: "Pizza",
    correct: true
}, {
    text: "Pasta",
    correct: false
}, {
    text: "Sushi",
    correct: false
}];
// use index 1 for the second choice in the list.
if(choicesArray[2][1].correct === true) {
    //it's right!
} else {
    //it's wrong...
}-->
